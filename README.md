# 🎨 Palette Extractor Web App

A simple web application that extracts dominant color palettes from an uploaded image.

Built using **HTML, CSS, and Vanilla JavaScript**, this project was created to explore DOM manipulation, image processing fundamentals, and interactive front-end development.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload an image from your device
- Automatically extract dominant colors
- Display generated color palette with HEX codes
- Dynamic UI updates
- Responsive layout design

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **HTML5**
- **CSS3**
- **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6)**

## 📚 Project Purpose

This project was developed as part of my front-end development learning journey. The main objectives were:

- Practice DOM manipulation
- Handle image uploads using JavaScript
- Work with pixel/color data processing
- Implement event-driven functionality
- Improve UI structuring and styling skills

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user uploads an image file.
2. JavaScript reads the image data.
3. Pixel color information is analyzed to determine dominant colors.
4. The extracted palette is dynamically rendered in the interface.
